Three formatting attributes fully specify 99% of tabular data formats:
1.	What, if any, delimiter is in use?
2.	What separator is in use?
3.	Is the separator subject to coalescing?

Delimiters ALWAYS occur in pairs and delimit the extent of a field.
Typically when delimiters are in use *anything* (including line-breaking
characters!) is allowed inside the delimiters. Delimiters are typically
double-quotes, but need not be. When delimiters are in use, if a delimiter
is to appear inside a field it must be escaped, often by doubling it.
Delimiters are usually used *with* separators.

Separators separate fields (and implicitly delimit) fields. Adjacent
separators imply an empty field. A separator is usually a character
completly prohibited from appearing *in* a field as there is typically
no defined escaping mechanism (though there could be).

When separators are used without delimiters every line should have the
exact same count of separator characters (and a field count one greater
than the separator count).

Whitespace *may* get special treatment at a line's start and end.

Moreover, not all combinations of these are actually used in practice.
For example, only whitespace is ever subject to coalescing.

CSV format is probably the worst of all in that delimiters are optional.
