H1	All lines are
	1) empty or contain
	2) data or
	3) non-data (header(s) or metadata).
H2	Headers are always initial non-empty line(s).
H3	Data lines *may* contain fields separated in some consistent way.
	Notably, they may not! FASTA and some other genomics files only contain
	one field per line.
	x	If any data line contains multiple fields, all data lines contain
		same number of fields. This is clearly not true for all, but
		reasonable for the majority of text data files. 
H4	File may contain scattered metadata lines.
	x	These often imply another level of organization, a block
		structuring, of the file and parameters such as fields-per-line
		might change across these "boundaries."
H5	Initial part of file (top N lines/X%) is representative of whole file.
	In particular line termination *should* be established at end of first
	line.

/**
  * Notes: The LF and CR ASCII characters are "inviolable" to this program.
  * In particular, they CANNOT appear inside fields; they ALWAYS indicate a
  * line termination. This is in violation to the RFC 4180 for "CSV" format.
  * The CSV format makes quoting optional.
  * Every format can potentially allow escaping or otherwise exceptional
  * treatment of potentially any character. For example CSV, allows LF/CR
  * inside fields as long as the fields are quoted. CSV's "escaping" of
  * double quotes is use of two adjacent quotes, not a backslash. It is
  * quite impossible to (efficiently) simultaneously check every possible
  * tabular format. Rely on heuristics.
