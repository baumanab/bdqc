INSTALLATION

python3 setup.py install

...will install the BDQC framework to the "standard" system location.
You may need to have root/sudo access to do this.  Alternatively,...

python3 setup.py install --prefix=$HOME

...will install it under you $HOME directory which is good practice
(to avoid polluting the system directory with special-purpose packages.)
If you install under $HOME, you may need to...

export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/lib/python3.3/site-packages"

...in your shell in order for python to find BDQC. Moreover, replace
"python3.3" above with your version.

python3 -c 'import sys;print(sys.path)'

...will tell you where python is going to look for things. If you've
exported PYTHONPATH, the directory you specified should be in there.

Finally,

python3 -m bdqc.scan -h shows you how to run it. See other documentation
for programmatic usage.
